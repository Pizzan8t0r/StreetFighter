The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing. It's a Powerful, Responsive & Raw Multi-Purpose Multi-Page & One-Page HTML5 Template based on Latest Bootstrap 5 Framework with Super Dark Mode and RTL Support. It can be used to build whatever you like with it such as this 2d fighting game.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images, but what about a snazzy JavaScript version of Streetfighter?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript, the <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics. A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content. After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing. The actual drawing is done using the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The fillRect() method places its top-left corner at (10, 10), and gives it a size of 150 units wide by 100 tall. The Canvas API is extremely powerful, but not always simple to use making this project quite fun but challenging in its own way. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene.
